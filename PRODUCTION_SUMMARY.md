   - Copy `.env.production.example` to `.env.production`
   - Fill in all CHANGE_ME placeholders
   - Review all configuration groups

3. **Database Setup**
   - Provision PostgreSQL 15 instance
   - Create database: `comunidad_viva`
   - Update DATABASE_URL in .env.production

4. **SSL Certificates**

   - Place in `nginx/ssl/` directory
   - Or use Let's Encrypt with certbot

5. **External Services**
   - Set up SMTP (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
   - Configure S3 bucket (AWS, DigitalOcean Spaces)
   - Create Sentry project (optional but recommended)
   - Set up Stripe account (for payments)

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Immediate Checks (First Hour)

1. **Health Endpoints**
   ```bash
   curl https://api.your-domain.com/health
   curl https://api.your-domain.com/health/status
   ```

2. **Frontend Access**
   - Visit https://your-domain.com
   - Verify page loads
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Register new account
   - Login
   - Verify JWT token works

4. **Core Features**
   - Create a post
   - Create an offer
   - Create an event
   - Send a message

5. **Monitor Logs**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   # Watch for errors or warnings
   ```

### First Day Monitoring

- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Response time < 500ms average
- [ ] No database connection issues
- [ ] No authentication failures
- [ ] All features working
- [ ] Backup job ran successfully
- [ ] SSL certificates valid

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
JWT_SECRET=<64-char-random-string>
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Important (Recommended)
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/...
```

See `.env.production.example` for complete list with detailed descriptions.

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur after deployment:

```bash
# 1. Stop current deployment
make stop

# 2. Restore database (if needed)
make restore
# Enter backup filename when prompted

# 3. Start previous version
git checkout <previous-version-tag>
make prod

# 4. Verify rollback successful
curl https://api.your-domain.com/health
```

## Support & Monitoring

### Health Check URLs
- Backend Health: `https://api.your-domain.com/health`
- Backend Status: `https://api.your-domain.com/health/status`
- API Documentation: `https://api.your-domain.com/api/docs` (dev only)

### Monitoring Services
- Logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090` (if monitoring enabled)
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3001` (if monitoring enabled)
- Sentry: Your Sentry dashboard

### Emergency Contacts
- Error Logs: Check Sentry dashboard
- Performance Issues: Check Grafana metrics
- Database Issues: Check PostgreSQL logs
- System Issues: Check Docker logs

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting:** Currently in-memory (single instance only)
   - For multi-instance: Implement Redis-based rate limiting
   - Upgrade path documented in FINAL_PRODUCTION_ASSESSMENT_2025.md

2. **Test Coverage:** ~40% (smoke tests only)
   - Plan: Increase to 80% over next 3 months
   - Critical paths have smoke tests

3. **Performance:** Not load tested
   - Recommendation: Start with conservative resources
   - Scale horizontally as needed

---

## Next Steps (Post-Launch)

### Week 1-2
- Monitor error rates closely
- Fix critical bugs immediately
- Collect user feedback
- Optimize based on usage patterns

### Week 3-4
- Implement unit tests for critical paths
- Add integration tests for main workflows
- Achieve 60% code coverage

### Month 2-3
- Implement Redis caching
- Optimize database queries
- Set up horizontal scaling
- Implement advanced monitoring
